Hi there, I'm José Castro 👋

I'm a passionate software developer and DevOps enthusiast who recently completed a post-grad in software development. During my studies, I dived deep into various technologies and tools, including Java, Maven, Gradle, Git, Vagrant, Docker, Jenkins, Spring Boot, REST, and REACT.

👀 Interests

I'm particularly fascinated by anything related to DevOps. I love exploring the latest tools and practices in the field and am always eager to learn more.

🌱 Current Learning Journey

Right now, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge in Docker and Kubernetes through a Udemy course. Following that, I plan to delve into Python and Ethical Hacking to broaden my skill set. I'm also keen to deepen my understanding of DevOps technologies and practices.

📚 Learning and Projects

During my post-grad, I worked on two main projects:

  - Smart Home App: A Java application supported by Spring Boot for managing smart home devices.
  - DevOps Project: A series of assignments to deepen knowledge in various DevOps technologies.

🌟 Achievements and Certifications

Both the Smart Home project and the DevOps project are highlights of my work, showcasing my skills and learning experiences in software development and DevOps.
